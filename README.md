## ⚙️ Algorithms

### 🕸️ Graph Search

#### **BFS – Breadth-First Search**

**Description:**  
Explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.  
Uses a **queue** data structure (FIFO).  

**Use cases:**  
- Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph  
- Network exploration  
- Maze solving  

📄 **File:** `bfs.py`

---

#### **DFS – Depth-First Search**

**Description:**  
Goes as deep as possible along one branch before backtracking.  
Uses a **stack** (or recursion).  

**Use cases:**  
- Exploring all nodes in a graph  
- Backtracking problems  
- Detecting cycles  

📄 **File:** `dfs.py`

## ▶️ How to Run

You can run any algorithm directly with **Python 3**:

```bash
python bfs.py
python dfs.py
